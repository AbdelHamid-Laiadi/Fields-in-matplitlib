This Python program reads renewable electricity generation data from a file (`germany-energy-sources.txt`),
 converts the values from gigawatt-hours to terawatt-hours, and creates a stacked bar chart showing
Germanyâ€™s renewable electricity production (from hydroelectric, wind, biomass, and photovoltaics) 
from 1990 to 2018. Each energy source is visually distinguished using different hatching patterns,
and the chart displays the total contribution of each source per year.
